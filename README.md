# rks1800018335 UAS
My name Bayu alif farisqi, i create this repository to completed assigment RKS in semester 5 class INT

In the Online Learning Application that I have created with the name "SENEO" or "Sekolah new Normal", it uses Android Studio to build its frontend the data used
is to use dummy data.
The Front End that I built follows or matches(Sesuai Dengan) the wireframe design, workflow, and documentation needs that I have made before UAS.even so there are some additional features that haven't been added to the front end design.
The following is the link to the previous UTS folder which contains workflows, wireframes, and required documentation:
